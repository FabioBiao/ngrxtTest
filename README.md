## ngRx introduction

NgRx/store is a library for managing state in your Angular applications, it is a reactive state management library powered by RxJS. Similar to Redux, this library can be used to manage the flow of data throughout your application, when actions are dispatched, reducers act on them and mutate the store. Another library weâ€™ll be working with is NgRx/effects. Effects are commonly used to handle side effects in your application, like fetching data from an external resource.

The first step is to create and assign actions. The actions will be mapped to constants using an enum.
